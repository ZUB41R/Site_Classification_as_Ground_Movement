# Site_Classification_as_Ground_Movement

This is an ongoing project with [uDrew](https://www.udrew.com.au/). The objective of this project is to predict the Site Classes that are categorized according to the amount of ground movement of a particular site location using a number of different Geospatial datasets which includes Geophysical (Gravity, Magnetic and Radiometric), Geological (Surface Geology) and ASTER images.

Here I have prepared the basic workflow which requires to be fine tuned in every step to improve the accuracy and confusion matrix. I have trained the data with a Neural Network at this stage. Additionally I have provided snippets that could be used in case of new feature sets that can be applied for prediction.
