# Site_Classification_as_Ground_Movement

This is an ongoing project where I am trying to predict the Site Classes that are categorized according to the amount of ground movement of a particular site location.

Here I have prepared the basic workflow which requires to be fine tuned in every step to improve the accuracy and confusion matrix. I have trained the data with a shallow Neural Network at this stage. Additionally I have provided snippets that could be used in case of new feature sets that can be applied for prediction.
